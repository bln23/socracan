          <h3 class="title-items">IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE</h3>
          <p>There is no agenda and there are no speakers before the event starts.
              Proposals are presented during the event itself in the mornings, and
              voted by the participants right after. It’s a great opportunity to speak
              to and code with many like-minded and talented developers in an incredible
              venue by the beach.</p>

          <h3 class="title-items">IT'S ABOUT ACTION</h3>
          <p>The retreat itself is free. The only thing you pay for is the hotel,
             meals and meeting rooms. We will be there for 48 hours to collaborate
             and share ideas. There will be hands-on coding sessions, sessions
             focused on discussion, interactive talks and lots more.</p>

          <h3 class="title-items">IT'S ABOUT FUN</h3>
          <p>We will not only spend the days together but also the nights. And
            – believe it or not – programmers are a great company! There will be
            lots of opportunities to spend your time. Starting with simple chilling
            over hiking and biking, playing games, hanging around, talking, laughing…</p>

          (around 3€, the grey hours correspond to direct routes) and walk 15 minutes
          by the beach or take a cab (around 35-45€ depending on hours).
          If you want to go sightseeing, you may consider renting a car since the
          public transportation in the city may not be as great as you would expect.
